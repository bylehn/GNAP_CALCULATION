This folder 'Tutorial_1' (for trial with all the input files like PMATRIX1.dat , population_neigh1.dat ,
ref1.gro and neighborhood1.dat) contains the following : 

1) 1000frames.xtc is a short test trajectory that has 1000 frames of GB1 protein system with 16 residues 
    having a total of 136 particles. 

2) myhead.h it stiores some important constants like in our case at hand 'NP' which the number of particles 
   in the system we are dealing with. In the test system provided the NP = 136.

3) plumed.dat is a plumed input script for calculating GNAP value for the test trajectory.

4) pmat.c : this is a c-program that generates certain input files that would be required by the input script 
   'plumed.dat'.

5) romega.cpp : This is a c++ program that calculates the minimum radius Romega (writes it in file named 
   Romega.dat) which will ensure a neighbourhood of 4 particle for all the particles in the protein. 
   This is to ensure a non-zero non-affinity to be captured for all the particles in the protein.

6) run.csh : this is a csh command which generates the necessary and required format files (ref.gro and ref.pdb later) 
   for the reference structure file 'start.pdb', saves an xyz coordinated of the refrence structure in the xyz.dat file, 
   runs the romega.cpp to generate the Romega value which is saved in Romega.dat file, runs the pmat.c program to generate 
   the other necessary files (neighbourhood1.dat , population_neigh1.dat and PMATRIX1.dat) , calculates the GNAP vlues 
   and finally moves all the files generated, by run.csh, except 'COLVAR' into a folder named 'DELETE' . 

7) start.pdb : this is a pdb format file for reference structure wrt which GNAP is to be calulcated for the test 
   trajectory '1000frames.xtc'

8) xyz.py   : this .py program extrats the xyz coordiantes and pbc box size and saves into the file named 'xyz.dat'

a) run.csh : "Gromacs" is required to generate ref.gro and ref.pdb from start.pdb. 

b) run.csh : "python" is required to extract the xyz coordinates and pbc-box from ref.pdb into a
   file named "xyz.dat".

c) pmat.c  : running this program requires "lapack" and "blas" packages to be installed in the system 
   to perform  some linear algebraic operations involved in the calculation of the projection matrix P 
   (for all the particles saved in PMATRIX.dat) which projects out the non-affine component of the total 
   displacement vector of all the particles' environment. The other outputs of pmat.c include 
   neighbourhood.dat and population_neigh1.dat. The command for compiling and this program are :
   1) compiling : gcc pmat.c -Ddsyev=dsyev_ -lm -llapack -lblas         and 
   2) running : ./a.out
   
d) run.csh : "Plumed" is required for the final calculation of GNAP from all the input files generated.
   The command used in run.csh for running the plumed is :
   1)../install_plumed_with_gnap/plumed/utility1/bin/plumed driver --mf_xtc 1000frames.xtc --plumed plumed.dat

1) Inside this folder named "tutorial_2", Make available the trajectory file for which the GNAP is to be 
   calculated. As a test system a file by name "1000frames.xtc" is provided. Also provided the reference
   structure in the .pdb format. The file named "start.pdb" is made available. The new trajectory file .xtc
   and the new refernce structure file .pdb, for which GNAP needs to generated, having any other name should 
   be updated in the files "run.csh" ,  "romega.cpp" and "pmat.c" .
   
2) Update the number of particles in two file 1) myhead.h and 2) plumed.dat , which for the given system
   is 136. The line "#define NP 136" in myhead.h  and the line "GNAP LABEL=gnap ATOMS=1-136..." in the 
   plumed input script "plumed.dat" needs to be updated.
   
3) Run the  csh file named "run.csh" using command :  csh run.csh 
   This will directly carry out the 4 steps mentioned in the above section "VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS" and generate 
   GNAP for the trajectory 1000frames.xtc  and save these values in file named 'COLVAR'.
