######  INPUT FILES CONTAINED IN TUTORIAL_1  ###########

This folder contains the following:


1) install        :This is basically a Folder that contains all the files required for the installation of
                  of plumed with GNAP incorporated as a new Collective Variable in it. The detailed theory
                  of the same is available in the work by Dheeraj et al. doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/840850 .
                  Inside this folder there is a bash script file called "install_plumed". One can directly 
                  install plumed by running the command:  bash install_plumed  



2)  tutorial_1    : This folder conatins all the required items for the GNAP calculation for the test system.
                  In this folder, along with the test trajectory(1000frames.xtc) and the reference structure
                  (ref1.gro), the other input files like PMATRIX1.dat , neighbourhood1.dat , population_neigh1.dat ,
                  the plumed input script (plumed.dat) and a .sh shell-script named GNAP.sh are provided. The 
                  details of all these files are provided in a README file provided inside the folder "tutorial_1".


3)  tutorial_2    : In this folder, Only the test trajectory 1000frames.xtc and the reference structure start.pdb are
                  provided. These two file can be replaced by any system's trajectory and reference structure for which
                  GNAP needs to be calculated while care must be taken to replace the names of the same must be updated
                  in the file "run.csh". Using Gromacs, start.pdb is used to generate the ref.pdb and ref.gro . Therefater,
                  using xyz.py, ref.pdb is used to capture xyz coordinates into the file xyz.dat. Then, using xyz.dat into
                  romega.cpp and pmat.c the other input files like PMATRIX1.dat ,neighbourhood1.dat & population_neigh1.dat
                  are generated which are in-turn used as input in plumed input-script "plumed.dat". The 
                  details of all these files are provided in a README file provided inside the folder "tutorial_2".
               









############  GETTING STARTED  ###########

STEP-1 : The first step that one needs to perform is to Install the plumed. Along with a plumed version one would
         also require a suitable and compatible openmpi version for the successful inatallation of plumed. Tar-file
         for the suitable version of both these (openmpi-1.8.8.tar.gz  and plumed-2.1.3.tgz) are made available in
         the folder named install. The bash script "install_plumed"  inside the folder "install" needs to be run in
         order to install the plumed successfully. The command used would be simply : bash install_plumed  
         
         
         
         
Step-2 : After the installation is done successfully, it would be advisable to first go for tutorial_1. Here the
         test trajectory , the reference structure and all the various other input files are made available. One
         can directly go into the folder "tutorial_1" through terminal , after installation , and  staright-away
         run the bash script "GNAP.sh" (command : bash GNAP.sh) . This would generate the GNAP values for the test
         system provided which is a short test trajectory that has 1000 frames of GB1 protein system with 16 
         residues having a total of 136 particles. The time-series of the GNAP values for the given trajectory
         would be saved in a file called "COLVAR" .  There is a separate README file made available inside the
         folder "tutorial_1" which mentions and expalins all the available files inside this folder and the 
         necessary actions to be performed. 
         
         
         
         
Step-3 : The step 3 requires some additional softwares to be install which include Gromacs, Python, BLAS & LAPACK.
         Once it is ensured that these things are available us in hand, we can straight-away go for tutorial_2,
         after the installation in the 1st step is acheived. In other words, one can skip the step-2 if Gromacs,
         Python, BLAS & LAPACK are already available in our system. Here again the same test system is provided
         which includes the short trajectory "1000frames.xtc" and its refrence strutcure "start.pdb". Ensuring
         the availability of these softwares, the user can also perform the calculation of GNAP for any other system
         providing its trajectory and reference structure and changing their names (which are originally 
         1000frames.xtc and start.pdb) in the file "run.csh" inside the folder "tutorial_2". Also, one needs to 
         update the no. of particles in the files "myhead.h" (line "#define NP 136") and "plumed.dat" ( line
         "GNAP LABEL=gnap ATOMS=1-136..."). For the test system, the number of particle is 136. There is a 
         separate README file made available inside the folder "tutorial_1" which mentions and expalins all
         the available files inside this folder and the necessary actions to be performed.
